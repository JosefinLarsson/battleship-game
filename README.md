# Credits

<li>General code was created from the developers own knowledge gained during Code Institute lessons on learning platform with particular focus on the "Love-Sandwiches" lesson but also highly influenced by the youtube video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tF1WRCrd_HQ by Knowledge Mavens.</li>


<li>Additionally much research, understanding and inspiration was gained from Code Institute slack forums, Stackoverflow.com, Python.org. Additional research done via the following youtube videos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwpS_ac8uk0&list=PL7Kw0NTafOcwRBM4vmOJ_0vDJhDjAE8s7&index=3 by Python Ninja and  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MgJBgnsDcF0&list=PL7Kw0NTafOcwRBM4vmOJ_0vDJhDjAE8s7&index=4&t=256s by CS Students.
